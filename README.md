Some spreadsheets in Excel with student marks that needs to be transferred to a Word template
I will use VBA through Excel.
The current Excel file is password locked, so first is just to copy the cell data and paste it into a new fresh one.
From there, a quick detour to just change the names and marks of the students, as this is personal information. This can quickly be accomplished with R.
Then back to VBA to extract the data and put it in the Word file.
This project requested for very specific values, but as a final touch, to create a userform for future use of similar situations.
